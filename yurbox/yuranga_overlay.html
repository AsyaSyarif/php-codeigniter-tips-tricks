            <h3>Fits into any enterprise environment</h3> <p> Stash doesn’t force you to use  a pre-packaged appliance you don’t have any control over – it runs
                on your servers. Built with infrastructure flexibility needs in mind, administrators  have full control over how Stash fits into their environment including
                database, operating system and authentication (such as HTTPS/SSH) </p>
